A detailed summary of the key L-BFGS-B optimizer parameters: (w.r.t base configuration)

```
factr=1e5, m=50, maxls=50, maxiter=30000
```

These are passed to `scipy.optimize.fmin_l_bfgs_b`, which implements the L-BFGS-B algorithm.

### 1. **factr**

- **Meaning:** Controls the convergence tolerance for the optimization. It determines when the optimizer should stop based on the relative reduction in the objective function.
- **Interpretation:** Lower values mean stricter convergence (the optimizer will run longer and try to find a more precise minimum). Higher values mean looser convergence (the optimizer may stop earlier).
- **Typical values:**
  - `1e12`: Low accuracy (fast, but less precise)
  - `1e7`: Moderate accuracy
  - `10.0`: Extremely high accuracy (slowest, most precise)
- **Your value:** `1e5` (quite strict, optimizer will run until the loss changes very little)

### 2. **m**

- **Meaning:** The number of corrections used to approximate the inverse Hessian matrix (the "memory" of the optimizer).
- **Interpretation:** Higher values allow the optimizer to use more past information, which can improve convergence for complex problems, but increases memory usage and computation per iteration.
- **Typical values:** 3–20 for small problems, 20–100 for large/deep networks.
- **Your value:** `50` (good for medium/large neural networks)

### 3. **maxls**

- **Meaning:** Maximum number of line search steps per iteration.
- **Interpretation:** During each L-BFGS-B iteration, the optimizer tries to find a good step size along the search direction. If it can't find a suitable step within `maxls` tries, it may terminate or skip the update.
- **Typical values:** 10–50.
- **Your value:** `50` (allows for thorough line search, can help with difficult loss landscapes)

---

### 4. **maxiter**

- **Meaning:** Maximum number of iterations (outer optimization steps).
- **Interpretation:** The optimizer will stop after this many iterations, even if convergence has not been reached.
- **Typical values:** 1000–100000, depending on problem size and convergence speed.
- **Your value:** `30000` (allows for long training, but may stop earlier if convergence is achieved)

## **Summary Table**

| Parameter | What it Controls                | Effect of Increasing | Effect of Decreasing | Your Value |
|-----------|---------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|------------|
| factr     | Convergence tolerance           | Stops earlier, less precise | Runs longer, more precise | 1e5       |
| m         | Memory for Hessian approximation| More memory, better convergence | Less memory, may converge slower | 50         |
| maxls     | Max line search steps/iteration | More robust, slower per iter | Faster, may fail to find good step | 50         |
| maxiter   | Max optimization iterations     | Runs longer          | May stop too soon  | 30000      |

## **Practical Tips**

- **factr**: If your optimizer stops too early, try lowering `factr` (e.g., `1e4` or `1e3`). If it runs too long with little improvement, increase it.
- **m**: If you have enough RAM and a large model, increasing `m` can help. For small models, lower values are fine.
- **maxls**: If you see line search failures, increase `maxls`.
- **maxiter**: Set high enough to allow convergence, but monitor your loss to avoid unnecessary computation.

**In summary:**  
These parameters control the precision, speed, and robustness of the L-BFGS-B optimizer. Tuning them can help balance training time and solution quality for your PINN.
