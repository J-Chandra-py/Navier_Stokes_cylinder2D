Summary: Streamline Visualization in 2D Flow
Purpose:
Streamlines visually represent the flow direction and structure in a 2D velocity field, similar to what you see in ParaView.

Data Used:

x, y: 2D meshgrid arrays for spatial coordinates.
u, v: 2D arrays for velocity components at each grid point.
How It Works:

The matplotlib.pyplot.streamplot function is used to plot streamlines.
It takes the meshgrid (x, y) and velocity fields (u, v) as input.
Streamlines are curves that are everywhere tangent to the velocity vector, showing the path a massless particle would follow in the flow.
Visualization Example:
``` python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(20, 8))
cf = ax.contourf(x, y, u, levels, cmap='rainbow')  # Contour plot for scalar field
plt.colorbar(cf)
ax.streamplot(x, y, u, v, color='k', density=2, linewidth=1, arrowsize=1.5)  # Streamlines
ax.add_patch(Circle((0.5, 0.5), 0.1, color="black"))  # Cylinder obstacle
plt.show()
```
Benefits:

Streamlines provide an intuitive understanding of flow patterns, recirculation zones, and wake regions.
Overlaying streamlines on contour plots gives both magnitude (color) and direction (lines) information.
