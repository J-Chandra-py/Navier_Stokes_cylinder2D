# Explanation of y_train (training data) Setup

The `y_train` list is used to define the expected outputs for training the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). It consists of six components, each corresponding to a specific boundary or domain condition:

### Structure of `y_train`
The final `y_train` list is structured as:
- `[zeros, onze, zeros, zeros, zeros, zeros]`

1. **zeros**:  
   This is a zero matrix of shape `(num_train_samples, 3)`. It represents the expected values for the equation residuals and boundary conditions where no specific flow behavior is defined.

2. **onze**:  
   This matrix is constructed to represent the inlet boundary condition. It is created by combining:
   - **`a`**: The velocity profile at the inlet, calculated using the `u_0` function. This function models the parabolic flow behavior at the pipe inlet, where the velocity is zero at the edges and maximum at the center.
   - **`b`**: A zero matrix of shape `(num_train_samples, 1)` to represent no vertical velocity at the inlet.
   - **`a`**: The same velocity profile as above, repeated for consistency in the expected output format.

   These components are concatenated along the last axis and then shuffled using `np.random.permutation` to ensure randomness in the training data.

3. **zeros (repeated)**:  
   The remaining components of `y_train` are zero matrices, representing the expected outputs for other boundary conditions (e.g., top-bottom boundaries, left-right boundaries, and the circular obstacle). These boundaries are assumed to have no specific flow behavior for simplicity.


This setup ensures that the PINN is trained to satisfy the governing equations and boundary conditions of the Navier-Stokes problem within the defined domain.
